# Maps

This directory contains maps for the Nuggets game.

to build, run `make`
to clean run `make clean`

Our Maps are the following:

* `customMap.txt`: our custom foobarbaz map

* `main.txt`: an interesting map for playing and testing.

* `fewspots.txt`: a map with too-few empty spots to support a game with 26 players and many gold piles.

* `small.txt`: a simple, small map; also too-few empty spots.

* `hole.txt`: a map similar to `main.txt`, but with a hole in the room

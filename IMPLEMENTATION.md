# fooBarBaz Nugget Project Implementation Spec

### About
<p> The nugget server reads the board, initializes the game, and then allows players to connect and play. The dynamics and control behind the game happen on the server side, while the inputs are given by and grid output is displayed to the client. All game functionality runs through the server. </p>


### Components
#### Server
* `static struct game`
    * Holds a `struct grid` for mapping purposes.
    * Holds `int num_players` which tracks current number of players.

* `struct grid`
    * Holds `int gold_remaining` which tracks remianing gold nuggets.
    * Contains mapping for the game struct with `int num_rows` and `int num_cols` storing number of rows and columns in map respectively.
    * Holds a 2D array of containing `cell` structures.
    * `int MaxPlayers` is the maximum number of players in the game
    * `player_t** players`Holds an array of non-spectator `player` structures.
    * `player *spectator*` holds a spectator `player` structure.

* `struct cell`
    * Contains properties of a cell object within the grid mapping of the game.
    * `char tag`, which holds the tag of the player occupying the cell. If no player is there, it holds `'\0'`.
    * `int gold`, which is the amount of gold in that cell. 0 if no gold. 
    * The default character to display when no character or gold is occcupying a cell is `default_char`.
    * Holds boolean indicating whether cell `is_walkable`.
    * `int row` is the row of th cell.
    * `int col` is the column.

* `struct player` (each held within an array)
    * Contains `char* player_name` which is the specific player's name.
    * Holds `char player_tag` which is the label  displayed on screen representing this player.
    * Holds `int gold_obtained` which indicates number of gold that has been obtained.
    * Contains `int row` which indicates the player's row position in the grid.
    * Contains `int col` which indicates the player's column position in the grid.
    * `addr_t* addr` is the address of connection to player. The `message.c` module from the support library will be used to communicate with the client.
    * Holds `char *display` which is the string which the player needs to output for the grid.
    * Holds a 2D array `int **known`, where `known[row][col] == 1` if the cell is known to the player, and `known[row][col] == 0` if it is not known.
    * Contains `bool player_quit` which tracks whether the player has disconnected.

### Psuedocode
#### Client module
<p> Reads and validates the path to logfile, hostname, port, and name. Client connects to the hostname and port, sending a message with the playerâ€™s name. Client listens for a char array from the server representing the display of the board. Client writes this display to the terminal window if window is large. Client listens for key inputs by the player, sends it to the server, and then handles the server's responses. If the player sends an EOF, the client exits. The client keeps updating until the server sends an end-of-game command. The client then listens for the scores of each player and displays them to the user. Finally, the client exits. </p>

* `main`
    * Attempts to initialize log file and message module.
    * Validates usage, namely hostname, port, and playername (if given).
    * If given playername and it exceeds maximum length, truncate automatically.
    * Attempts to set address to given hostname and port.

    * Initializes ncurses display.
    * Depending on whether client is player or spectator, sends appropriate join message to server.
    * Begins message loop by passing `handle_stdin` and `handle_message` methods.
    * Shut down message module and closes log module
    * Exits with status code 0 if message loop ends due to handler return true; otherwise, exit with status code 4 due to fatal error for which message loop could not keep looping.

* `bool handle_stdin(void *arg)`
    * If argument, ie. address to correspondent, is null, return true to break.
    * If address is valid, upon key press, sends message containing key to server.
    * Otherwise, if address is invalid, notifies user.
    * Return false to exit.

* `bool handle_message(void *arg)`
    * If argument, ie. address to correspondent, is null, return true to break.
    * If message begins with "OK ", return `handle_accept(message)`.
    * Otherwise, if message begins with "NO ", return `handle_reject(message)`.
    * Otherwise, if message begins with "GRID ", return `handle_grid(message)`.
    * Otherwise, if message begins with "DISPLAY", return `handle_display(message)`.
    * Otherwise, if message begins with "GOLD ", return `handle_gold(message)`.
    * Otherwise, if message begins with "QUIT", return `handle_quit(message)`.
    * Otherwise, if message begins with "GAMEOVER", return `handle_gameover(message)`.
    * Otherwise, return false

* Helper Modules
    * `void initialize_curses()`

        *  If client is spectator, hides cursor.  
    * `void update_statusline(const char *message)`
        * Stores current location of cursor.
        * If client is player,
	        * Updates status line detailing status of the player, including player tag, nuggets claimed, and total nuggets unclaimed in map.
	        * If nuggets were recently picked up by player, displays amount on status line.
	     * Otherwise, if client is spectator, updates status line detailing nuggets unclaimed in map.
	     * If error message from server is received,
	        * Appends status line with error message.
	        * Returns cursor to original location.
    * `void update_display`
        * For each character in map string,
	        * Displays character on screen in appropriate location.
	        * If character is client's tag (@), saves its specific location on map.
	     * Moves cursor to hover over client's tag.

    * `bool handle_accept(const char *message)`
        * Scans acceptance message for character indicating player's tag on map.
        * Return false.

	        * Notifies client that unable to join becase too many players are on server.
	        * Return true to break.

        * Otherwise, uses `update_statusline` to notify client with rejection message. Returns false.
    * `bool handle_grid(const char *message)`
        * Extracts numbers of rows and columns in map from message.
        * If terminal window fits is too small for said dimensions,
	        * Notifies user to resize window.
	        * Waits until ENTER is pressed and window has been resized appropriately.
        * Begin listening for future window resizes (not allowed).
        * Return false.

    * `bool handle_display(const char *message)`
        * Stores map as string received as message.
        * Uses `update_statusline` and `update_display` to refresh screen.

        * Return true to break.

#### Server module

### Security, error handling, and recovery
<p>Arguments are validated for the server and client. Specifically, the server validates that there is a correct number of arguments and that there is a readable file for the map filename passed. It also validates that the seed is an integer if provided one. The client reads and validates the path to logfile, hostname, port and name. The client sends all inputs from the player to the serverâ€“validation is done on the server side. We will conduct unit testing on server client interaction, the presentation of the game in the client module, the game control functionality from client to server, and the board display on the client end when players exit, the game ends, or players move as they obtain gold. Once all of those tests are passed, we can test the game as a whole.</p>
